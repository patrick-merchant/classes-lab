# Laptop Reset Instructions

Before you send back your laptop we need you to follow some steps to reset it for the next user. This will ensure that they don't have copies of your coursework or projects already on their system and give them a clean slate to work from.

1. Ensure any projects, practical exercises or files you have worked on during lessons are backed up. You can upload them to GitHub or copy them to an external storage device. If you use GitHub ensure that you don't have any repositories nested inside each other.

2. Sign out of any online services you have accessed using this laptop, eg. GitHub, personal email, etc.

3. Ensure you have backed up any job-related documents such as CVs.

4. Unpair any Bluetooth devices such as headphones or mice. To do this go to `System Preferences > Bluetooth` and click the cross next to the device in the list.

5. Open `About This Mac` and check the type of processor your laptop has.

6. Follow the appropriate instructions for resetting your system. If you have an Intel chip follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208496). If you have an M1/Apple silicon chip use [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212030).

7. Re-install MacOS as per the last step in those instructions. **Do not complete the setup process!** The next user will complete this using their own information.

If you have any issues contact one of the trainers who can help you through the process.
